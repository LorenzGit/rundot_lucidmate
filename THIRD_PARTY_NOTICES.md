# Third-party notices

LEADLIGHT's direct runtime dependencies are distributed under the following
licenses, as declared by the installed packages audited on 2026-07-27:

| Package | Reviewed version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@series-inc/rundot-game-sdk` | 5.24.0 | MIT |

The lockfile also resolves transitive and development dependencies. Their
license texts ship in their npm packages and remain controlling. Re-run a
dependency-license review whenever the lockfile changes, preserve required
copyright and attribution notices, and include applicable notices with any
distributed compiled build. This file does not replace those license texts.

## Development and QA tooling

| Package | Reviewed version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `playwright-core` | 1.62.0 | Apache-2.0 |

Playwright drives `scripts/visual-qa.mjs` and `scripts/make-thumbnail.mjs` for
local and CI verification. It is not included in the compiled game bundle.

## Assets

None. Every texture, backdrop, store tile, and sound in this game is generated
at runtime by its own code (`src/game/art/` and `src/audio/`), so no image,
font, or audio file is redistributed here.

The repository's own materials are governed by [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
