/**
 * LUCIDMATE funnel registry.
 *
 * `lucidmate_first_run` is reproduced here EXACTLY as it shipped — same name,
 * same three step names, same numbers — because it has real history and is one
 * of only two funnels in the portfolio that was ever readable. Nothing about
 * it changes; it simply moves behind the shared helper.
 *
 * A `lucidmate_first_run_detail` companion funnel was once declared here, but
 * its steps described another game's piece/line mechanics (this is a chess
 * title — there is no "line fired" beat) and no step of it ever emitted a row.
 * The declaration was pruned rather than renumbered: a funnel with zero
 * shipped data has no trend line to preserve. If in-match detail beats are
 * ever wanted, declare a NEW funnel named for the chess loop's real moments.
 *
 * Step names and numbers are frozen: add new beats at the end, never renumber.
